# Introduction

Welcome! This post demonstrates a well-structured Markdown file compatible with the **Chirpy** Jekyll theme. Use this as a template: replace text, images, and metadata to suit your post.

> Tip: Keep front matter fields minimal but descriptive — Jekyll + Chirpy will render the rest.

## What this post includes

* Front matter compatible with Chirpy.
* Title, date, categories, and tags.
* A cover image and author metadata.
* Examples of headings, callouts, images, code blocks, and lists.

---

## Section: Example image



*Use your own images — place them in `assets/images/` and update the `cover` / inline paths.*

## Section: Code sample

```bash
# Example: build and serve locally
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

```ruby
# Example _config.yml snippet for Chirpy
theme: "chirpy"
plugins:
  - jekyll-seo-tag
  - jekyll-sitemap
```

## Callouts

> **Note**: Chirpy supports many useful features (TOC, math, callouts, badges). Enable them in the front matter or global config.

> **Warning**: If you add custom plugins on GitHub Pages, they might be restricted. Use GitHub Actions to build if you rely on unsupported plugins.

## Inline HTML (for advanced layout)

<div class="grid">
  <div class="card">This is a simple card example using Chirpy utilities.</div>
</div>

## Checklist

* [x] Title and date set
* [x] Categories and tags added
* [x] Cover image configured
* [x] Code blocks tested locally

## SEO & Social

Add an appropriate `summary` and `cover` to improve sharing cards on social networks. Chirpy picks up these fields automatically when present.

## Conclusion

That's it — a ready-to-use Chirpy-compatible Markdown post. Edit the front matter, substitute content, and publish.
